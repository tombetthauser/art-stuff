# ðŸŒ» Visual Art Projects

Select individual artworks and ongoing projects from my personal visual art practice. My studio practice is currently based at the Verge Center for the Arts in Sacramento, CA where I am an ongoing studio resident. 

For more information on my background please visit my [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/tombetthauser/). For information regarding my exhibition record please see my CV (link coming soon). I do have an [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/tombetthauser/) that I maintain for professional purposes. That said I don't personally enjoy using social media so I'm in the progress of automating my account via a separate script project.

## Current Project Links

[Studio Images Blog Feed](https://tombetthauser.github.io/studio_blog/) | [Project GitHub Repo](https://github.com/tombetthauser/studio_blog)

An experiment to semi-automate / simplify sharing in-progress studio shots via a repo and stand-alone html page that are updated by running a script that scrapes an iCloud album which is easily added to / changed on a mobile device.

## Current Portfolio Images

Coming soon. Should scrape an iCloud album and process automatically into this readme similar to the update process in the studio images blog feed project...

## Past Exhibitions / CV

Coming soon. Should maybe scrape from a resource easy to edit on a mobile device like a Google Doc / Sheet or just pull from a raw text file stored in this repo...
